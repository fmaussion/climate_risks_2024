# IPCC AR6 WG2 - Part 1

## Before the workshop

1. Access the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) from the IPCC AR6 WG2 report [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/).
2. Have a skim through the SPM up until *"Section C: Adaptation Measures and Enabling Conditions"* (excluded) and identify the key messages and figures.

## Introduction

*(15 minutes)*

Fabien will briefly explain the role of the IPCC, WG2, and WG1. We form the thematic groups and introduce the breakout group activity.

## Breakout groups

For the first two workshops on the IPCC WG2, you will be split into three groups. Each group will be assigned a broader theme (see below) and will discuss it in more depth. The goal is to identify the key impacts for each theme and to choose an impact in particular to work on for the next workshop. The timings below are indicative and can be adjusted as needed.

### (Quiet) reading time

*(~ 30 minutes)*

Groups read relevant parts of the SPM (this now includes also the sections including and after *"C: Adaptation Measures and Enabling Conditions"*) and identify as many impacts as possible within their theme. Each group member should list these impacts for themselves and take personal notes. If you can, incorporate the time horizon as well: are these impacts already occurring? If not, when are these impacts expected to occur?

If you have time, have a look at one of the [](inter-atlas) to see if you can find more impacts there. I recommend starting with the [PROVIDE Climate Risk Dashboard](https://climate-risk-dashboard.iiasa.ac.at)!

### Group discussion

*(~ 30 minutes)*

As a group, try to obtain a comprehensive list of impacts within your theme. Discuss the most important impacts and for each one, identify the hazard, what creates exposure, and who or what might be vulnerable under certain conditions (present or future?). This is a wide-ranging discussion! Aim to cover as many impacts as possible, but no need to go too deep in the details here. The aim is to have a good overview and enough information to choose a specific impact to focus on for the next item.

## Preparation for next week

*(~ 20 minutes)*

As a group, you will be expected to prepare a short presentation for the next workshop. The presentation should include all three components of climate risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. At this stage you will need to:

- focus on one specific impact within your theme to focus on. The impact should be relevant enough to have enough litterature to work with, but not too broad to be unmanageable. You may find it useful to choose an impact that is covered in the one of the [](inter-atlas), but it is not mandatory.
- assign roles within the group: two to focus on hazard, two on exposure, and two on vulnerability. Each role will be responsible for gathering information on their respective component of the risk. For example, can you find examples of the impact you chose in the literature? What are the key drivers of the *hazard*? What are the key drivers of *exposure*? Who or what is *vulnerable* to this impact?
- it might be a good idea to find a case study to work with, e.g. a specific region or country that is particularly vulnerable to the impact you chose. Maybe this can be something based on recent events, or a region which will be particularly affected in the future.
- start gathering information on the impact you chose. You can use the SPM, the full report, and other sources you find relevant.

## Plenary sharing

*(15 minutes, 5 minutes per group)*

Each group summarize the list of impacts they identified, and present the impact they chose to focus on for the next workshop.

## Themes

1. **Ecosystems and biodiversity** *(natural systems)*
   - Climate impacts on natural ecosystems and biodiversity, including non-human species and ecological processes.
   - Example impacts include voral reef bleaching due to ocean warming, shifts in species distributions (e.g., alpine flora moving to higher altitudes), etc.
2. **Human systems (health, food, and water)** *(societal systems)*
   - Climate impacts on human well-being and livelihoods, emphasizing agriculture, water security, and public health. This theme applies across rural and urban contexts.
   - Example impacts include reduced crop yields due to drought in agricultural regions, water scarcity for populations dependent on snow and ice melt, etc.
3. **Urban and infrastructure systems** *(built systems)*
   - Climate impacts on cities and infrastructure, including transportation, energy systems, and housing. Emphasis is on infrastructure resilience and adaptation.
   - Example impacts include flooding of urban areas from sea-level rise and heavy rainfall, energy grid failures, etc.

Like everything else in our climate system, the three themes are interlinked!
