    "Having calculated the cost of Hurricane Katrina in 2015, lets consider the impacts of the same flood event, but in one of the SSP projected future scenarios. In the data folder you downloaded, you'll find two additional SFINCS simulations of the flood event. These use the same meterological forcing as the historic simulation, but they have had sea level uplifted to that indicated by the AR6 sea level projections. It's a crude approximation, but allows to answer the question: \"what would be the impact of Hurricane Katrina with higher sea levels?\""
