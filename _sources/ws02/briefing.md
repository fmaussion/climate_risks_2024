# IPCC AR6 WG2 - Part 2

## Before the workshop

At this stage, each group should have identified a hazard they want to focus on, and each group member should already be assigned one of three roles:

- Hazard specialist: Investigate the physical hazard (e.g., its drivers, trends, and intensity).
- Exposure specialist: Explore what is exposed and why (e.g., populations, assets, or ecosystems).
- Vulnerability specialist: Examine who or what is vulnerable and the reasons behind it.

In the week leading to the workshop:

1. Review the impact your group selected in Week 1, focusing on its hazard, exposure, and vulnerability components.
2. Explore the interactive tools provided below (they may not contain information for your chosen impact!):
   - [PROVIDE Climate Risk Dashboard](https://climate-risk-dashboard.iiasa.ac.at)
   - [Met Office Climate Data Portal](https://climatedataportal.metoffice.gov.uk/)
   - [IPCC Interactive Atlas](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch)
   - [Climate Impact Explorer](https://climate-impact-explorer.climateanalytics.org)
3. Gather relevant information about your impact using the SPM, the full IPCC report, or other credible sources (e.g. peer reviewed papers or newspapers). Focus on:
   - Drivers of the hazard.
   - Factors contributing to exposure.
   - Characteristics of vulnerable populations or systems.

## Breakout groups

*(60 minutes)*

1. **Group meeting:**
   - Review and consolidate the information gathered during the preparation phase.
   - Discuss any gaps or unclear areas within the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability components.

2. **Presentation preparation:**
   - Collaboratively create a presentation that includes:
     - A brief introduction to the selected impact.
     - Key findings on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
     - A case study or regional example, if applicable.
   - Ensure that the presentation:
     - Clearly explains how the three components (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) interlink to create risk.
     - Identifies gaps, uncertainties, or areas for further research.
   - Allocate speaking roles within the group.

## Group Presentations

*(45 minutes â€“ 15 minutes per group)*

1. **Presentation (8 minutes per group):**
   - Each group presents their findings, focusing on:
     - The nature of the impact.
     - The interconnection of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
     - Notable insights or case study highlights.

2. **Q&A and feedback (6 minutes per group):**
   - Class discussion on each presentation, including questions and feedback.

## Wrap-Up
