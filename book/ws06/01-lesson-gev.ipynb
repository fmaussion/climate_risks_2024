    "We have seen above that even a very small change in the data series can have large consequences for the computation of return levels and return periods, especially for very rare events. Intuitively, this makes sense: rare events are, by definition, rare and difficult to predict. Until they actually occur, we are prone to making large errors in estimating their probability of occurrence or their intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to understand this uncertainty is by considering the 1968 flood event. It occurred after only 10 years of measurements, meaning that if we had performed this exercise at the time, its empirical return period would have been estimated at 10 years. Today, after 60 years of measurements, the empirical return period has increased to 60 years because no stronger event has occurred since. In short, we have likely still underestimated the true return period of this event, as we can't predict how long this event will continue to be the largest ever recorded.\n",

    "> - We pull artificial observations from our data - with replacement.\n",
    "> - We draw as many observations as our data record is long. This record will now only include data points that we observed before, but some will show up several times, some not at all.\n",

    "Okay, so we agree that the Gaussian distribution is not an accurate representation of our data. This is because the Gaussian distribution is determined by only two parameters (the mean and the standard deviation) and is symmetric around its central value. However, extreme value histograms often exhibit a “thick tail” formed by rare, extreme events. Fortunately, other distributions can better capture these characteristics. Let’s explore the [generalized extreme value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution) (GEV) distribution.\n",

    "The GEV distribution introduces a third parameter. The location and scale parameters behave similarly to the mean and standard deviation in a normal distribution. However, the shape parameter impacts the tails of the distribution, making them either thinner or thicker. Since extreme event distributions often exhibit thick tails, they are typically better represented by the GEV distribution.\n",

The three GEV parameters (location, scale, and shape) can be estimated from data using the `gev.fit()` method. The second argument in `gev.fit()`, shown in the example below, is optional (it provides an initial guess for the shape parameter). In some cases, setting this to zero is beneficial, as the fitting algorithm can be unstable and may return incorrect values otherwise. (*Hint: Always check if your results make sense!*)"

    "In this lesson, we've explored the process of modeling extreme events using both empirical methods and the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. By fitting the GEV distribution to our data, we've gained a more nuanced understanding of return periods and return levels, which are essential for predicting the likelihood of future extreme events.\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empirical return periods**, while straightforward, may not provide accurate estimates for rare events, especially with limited data.\n",
    "- The **GEV distribution** offers a comprehensive framework for modeling extremes, accommodating various types of tail behaviors.\n",
