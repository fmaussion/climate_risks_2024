    "# Lesson: hazard, vulnerability and exposure during Hurricane Katrina\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop focuses on using vulnerability and exposure data to analyze the impacts of [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) on the city of New Orleans and its surroundings. This final workshop of the unit is the closest to a **real-world climate risk analysis** for a past extreme event—sometimes called a **\"hindcast\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "This lesson is... quite dense. It introduces more advanced programming tools for overlaying vulnerability and exposure data with hazard data (in this case, a flood extent map). However, <b>you don't need to understand all of it</b>. The assignment will only require you to copy and adapt (very) small parts of this code. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide these advanced tools in the hope that they might be useful in your future work or in your dissertation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Learning outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will:\n",
    "- have a good overview of the fundamental concepts of climate risk assessments, including hazard identification, exposure, and vulnerability.\n",
    "- learn how to use familiar and new Python libraries to process and analyze geospatial flood data.\n",
    "- create informative visualizations of flood extents and damage to interpret potential impacts effectively.\n",
    "- be able to integrate population datasets to estimate the number of individuals affected by varying hazard levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** [Hamish Wilkinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamish-wilkinson-87b34a185) ran the flood simulations, prepared all the data and exercises, and wrote an initial draft of this notebook. Fabien Maussion reviewed and streamlined it."
