    "\n",
    "- We opened and processed OGGM projection data.\n",
    "- We examined glacier-wide and basin-wide volume evolution over time.\n",
    "- We explored the importance of climate model ensembles and how to summarize them with quantiles instead of spaghetti plots.\n",

    "This is where your assignment comes in! You will now take the tools from this lesson and apply them to real-world climate impact questions, such as:\n",
    "- How much glacier volume will be lost by 2100?\n",
    "- How do different climate scenarios (e.g., SSP126 vs. SSP585) affect glacier evolution?\n",
    "- What are the key uncertainties, and how do we interpret them?\n",
